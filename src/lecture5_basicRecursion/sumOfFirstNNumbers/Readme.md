# Sum of cube of first N numbers

GFG - [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-first-n-terms5843/1)

Given an integer n, calculate the sum of series 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + â€¦ till n-th term.

Note :- Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

#### Example 1 :

    Input: n=5
    Output: 225
    Explanation: 13+23+33+43+53 = 225

#### Example 2 :

    Input: n=7
    Output: 784 
    Explanation: 1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3+5^3+6^3+7^3=784

#### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `sumOfSeries()` which takes the integer n as a parameter and returns the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.

#### Expected Time Complexity: `O(1)`

#### Expected Space Complexity: `O(1)`

#### Constraints:

-    `1 <= n <= 50000`
