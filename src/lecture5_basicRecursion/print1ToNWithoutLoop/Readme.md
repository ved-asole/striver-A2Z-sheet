# Print 1 To N Without Loop

GFG - [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-1-to-n-without-using-loops-1587115620/1)


Print numbers from `1 to N` without the help of loops. You only need to complete the function `printNos()` that takes `N` as parameter and prints number from `1 to N` recursively.

Note :- Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

Example 1:

    Input: n = 10
    Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Example 2:

    Input: n = 5
    Output: 1 2 3 4 5

### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `printNos()` which takes an integer `N` as an input parameter and prints all number from `1 to N`.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)

Expected Space Complexity: O(n) (Recursive)

Constraints:

-    `1 <= n <= 1000`
