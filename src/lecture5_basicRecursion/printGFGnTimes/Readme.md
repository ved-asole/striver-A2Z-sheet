# Print GFG n times

GFG - [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-gfg-n-times/1)

Print GFG n times without the loop.

Note :- Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

#### Example:

    Input: 5
    Output: GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG

#### Your Task:

This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function `printGfg()` that takes `N` as parameter and prints `N` times GFG recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

#### Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`

#### Expected Space Complexity: `O(n) (Recursive)`

#### Constraints:

-    `1 <= n <= 1000`
