# Print N to 1 without loop

GFG - [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-n-to-1-without-loop/1)

Print numbers from `N to 1` (space separated) without the help of loops.

Note :- Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

#### Example :

    Input: N = 10
    Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

#### Your Task:

This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function `printNos()` that takes `N` as parameter and prints number from `N to 1` recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

#### Expected Time Complexity: `O(N)`

#### Expected Space Complexity: `O(N) (Recursive)`

#### Constraints:

-    `1 <= n <= 1000`
